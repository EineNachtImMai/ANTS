# ANTS

## Project rundown

***ANTS*** (**A**lright **N**ote-**T**aking for **S**TEM) is a markdown editor and note-taking app aimed specifically at STEM students.

It is currently in the (very) early stages of development, but here are *some* of the feature I intend to add in the future:
- LaTeX syntax integration
- SMILES syntax interpretion for chem, and a way to integrate different molecular representations (namely Cram, Lewis, Newman and Fischer) *(sadly, I still have no idea how to do that)*
- native PDF annotation (source: my teachers give us PDFs to fill and doing it on PC would be cool)
- a way to make quick sketches

## How to run

just go into the project and run
```
npm run tauri dev
```
## Afterword
