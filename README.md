# ANTS

***ANTS*** (**A**wesome **N**ote-**T**aking for **S**TEM) is a markdown editor and note-taking app aimed specifically at STEM students.

It is currently in the early stages of development, but here are *some* of the feature I intend to add in the future:
- LaTeX syntax integration
- SMILES syntax interpretion for chem, and a way to integrate different molecular representations (namely Cram, Lewis, Newman and Fischer) *(sadly, I still have no idea how to do that)*
- a way to make quick sketches

If you have any suggestions / bug reports / wanna help, dont hestate to drop in and contact me!
